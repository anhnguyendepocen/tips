## How to upgrade kernels from the command line

From [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/221/how-to-force-installation-of-kernel-updates-when-using-apt-get-upgrade)


After a little research, what you probably want to use is:

```
aptitude safe-upgrade
```
which does install new kernels. You should probably prefer
``aptitude`` in general to ``apt-get`` anyway, unless
you specifically need something in ``apt-get``.
