# Handling problem specimens that charge

## Comments from Steve Chapman 2015-10-07 (protrain@emcourses.com)

These comments came from the microscopy listserver in response to a question about imaging a problematic leather specimen.

> Sounds as if you are trying, but if the charge is worse with dropping to 5 kV
that tells me you have lost the BSE contribution, this will be a big problem
whist using a TTL system. The converted BSE provide SE, but because they are
derived from BSE they do not carry so much charge information

> The approach to a problem specimen should be as follows:

> 1. Use the smallest possible piece of material, fixed to the stub with
a good quality conducting media.
> 2. Start at the lowest kV that you are able to work with, and a small
spot size; all aimed at not damaging or charging the specimen.  If you use a
TTL system go to the standard detector in the lower chamber, with about 7 mm
working distance.  You need a contribution of converted BSE (less charge)
which you are unlikely to have with TTL detection. If the signal is too low,
slightly increase the spot size.
> 3. If the specimen is not giving you a problem other than resolution,
increase the magnification using a fast scan if possible, to reduce the
intensity of beam on a particular area.
> 4. Having increased the magnification, as resolution is the problem,
increase the kV slightly (e.g. if you were using 1kV go to 1.5kV).
> 5. As long as there is no charge continue stepping up the kV until you
are happy with the result or the specimen charges.  If you charge the
specimen take it to air to discharge it, and go back to an earlier kV.
Slight charge may be reduced by reducing the spot size slightly.
> 6. If resolution is still the problem, try moving the specimen closer
to the final lens by a few mm, not too close as you will lose the very
valuable converted BSE.
> 7. Still a resolution problem, if you have a TTL system try 10 mm WD
then in steps down to 5 mm WD with this system, and see if you are able to
obtain a satisfactory result (with many TTL systems between 7 mm and 5 mm
works).
> 8. All of the time you are looking for a mix of kV, spot size, and WD
that provides the best mix of signal and therefore performance.

## Comments from Gary Brown (microscopy.gmb@gmail.com)

> I agree with what Steve had to say and have some additional comments.

> - A sample of a square centimeter or so is probably not too large.
The conductive media should make a continuous electrical connection
between the bare metal stub and the upper surface and continuing onto
the upper surface of the sample.  I often use Leit C carbon adhesive
from my friendly microscopy supply house because it combines
electrical conductivity with excellent mechanical strength that
materials like colloidal graphite (DAG) and silver paint don't have.
Silver paint can also be problematic in EDS analysis.

> -  The power that field emission SEM offers is incredibly bright
source combined with a stable low voltage beam.  Secondary electron
imaging (SEI) at low voltage provides the best topographical analysis
of surface roughness.  Charge control in SEI is achieved by balancing
the number of incident electrons entering the sample and electrons
leaving as secondary and backscattered electrons.  I highly recommend
the book "Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis", 3rd
Edition by Goldstein et al., Springer, 2013.  The chapter on
Procedures for Elimination of Charging in Nonconducting Specimens
should be very helpful.

> -  My 25 years of experience in low voltage, field emission SEM of
polymers leads me to believe that some of the imaging problems
experienced with leather may be similar to those observed in polymers.
Both are insulators and consist of low atomic weight elements.  Like
Steve, I suggest you start at around 1 kV accelerating voltage.  Use
the spot size that the service engineers use to check your spatial
resolution at 1 kV: this spot size is a good place to start because
the manufacturer knows it gives an excellence balance of resolution
and signal-to-noise.

> -  For best results, I suggest you work with an uncoated sample.  You
might start with a coated sample then move to the bare, uncoated
sample.  Gold and gold-palladium coatings will obscure possibly
important surface information.

> -  Faster scan rates produce less charging than longer scan rates.
If a single scan allows you to control charging but is somewhat noisy,
average several scans recorded using shorter scan rates.  Do a few
quick tests on fresh areas of the sample to see how long a scan rate
you can use without producing charging.  Be aware that your default
image acquisition scan rate may be much longer than the ideal scan
rate for your sample. If this happens, record your images at the
preferred rate.

> -  Fortunately, sub-micrometer surface texture and porosity (as I
would expect to see in collagen-based leather surfaces) dissipate
charging thus making imaging easier.
