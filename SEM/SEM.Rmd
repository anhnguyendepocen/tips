# Handling problem specimens that charge

## Comments from Steve Chapman 2015-10-07

These comments came from the microscopy listserver in response to a question about imaging a problematic leather specimen.

> Sounds as if you are trying, but if the charge is worse with dropping to 5 kV
that tells me you have lost the BSE contribution, this will be a big problem
whist using a TTL system. The converted BSE provide SE, but because they are
derived from BSE they do not carry so much charge information

> The approach to a problem specimen should be as follows:

> 1. Use the smallest possible piece of material, fixed to the stub with
a good quality conducting media.
> 2. Start at the lowest kV that you are able to work with, and a small
spot size; all aimed at not damaging or charging the specimen.  If you use a
TTL system go to the standard detector in the lower chamber, with about 7 mm
working distance.  You need a contribution of converted BSE (less charge)
which you are unlikely to have with TTL detection. If the signal is too low,
slightly increase the spot size.
> 3. If the specimen is not giving you a problem other than resolution,
increase the magnification using a fast scan if possible, to reduce the
intensity of beam on a particular area.
> 4. Having increased the magnification, as resolution is the problem,
increase the kV slightly (e.g. if you were using 1kV go to 1.5kV).
> 5. As long as there is no charge continue stepping up the kV until you
are happy with the result or the specimen charges.  If you charge the
specimen take it to air to discharge it, and go back to an earlier kV.
Slight charge may be reduced by reducing the spot size slightly.
> 6. If resolution is still the problem, try moving the specimen closer
to the final lens by a few mm, not too close as you will lose the very
valuable converted BSE.
> 7. Still a resolution problem, if you have a TTL system try 10 mm WD
then in steps down to 5 mm WD with this system, and see if you are able to
obtain a satisfactory result (with many TTL systems between 7 mm and 5 mm
works).
> 8. All of the time you are looking for a mix of kV, spot size, and WD
that provides the best mix of signal and therefore performance.
