``Slidify`` is a package by Ramnath Vaidyanathan that may be used
to create HTML5 slides from R.


**2015-05-04 Note:** There is an incompatibility between the latest version of `Slidify` and the release version of `stringr` caused by a problem with processing regular expressions. The current workaround is to install `stringr-0.6.2` from the `CRAN` archives.

# Installation
One installs Slidify from github in R with the commands

```
library(devtools)
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')
```
# Getting started
RV provides some helpful tips to get started on his
[github](https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify) page.

Here are the first steps (from R)

```
setwd("~/work/play")
library(slidify)
author("testSlidify")
```

This creates a basic framework in directory ``jrmSlides`` with
an ``index.Rmd`` template and an ``assets`` directory. When you
edit the ``index.Rmd`` template and ``Knit HTML`` in RStudio, this
creates the ``index.md`` and ``index.html`` files and a ``libraries``
directory. It helps to create a RStudio project in the directory...

If you want a splash image on a starter slide and a logo on the
title slide, add

```
logo        : M3A-large.png
biglogo     : mandrill.png 
```
just above ``framework`` in the YAMML top matter and put the images
in the ``assets/img`` directory.

We probably want to change
```
widgets     : []  # {mathjax, quiz, bootstrap}
```
to
```
widgets     : [mathjax]  # {mathjax, quiz, bootstrap}
```

Then run ``Knit HTML`` in RStudio
to incorporate the changes.

**Note:** I have a template (index.Rmd) in `templates/Rmd/Slidify` and a `slidify.css` file in `global/css/`. Also have some logos in `global/png/`


# Alchemy

## io2012
``io2012`` is a convenient framework for slides. I find the default
text too small and like to add some color to the title slide. We
need to edit files in the ``libraries/frameworks/io2012`` directory.

Want to double check this one in my current template... 

## css/slidify.css
change the ``article`` styles

```
article p, article li, article li.build{
  font-family: 'Helvetica', 'Crimson Text', 'Garamond',  'Palatino', sans-serif;
  text-align: justify;
  font-size:36px;
  line-height: 1.5em;
  color: #474747;
}
```

## Overriding a single instance from the .css

Here is a case where the default left margin for a quote (50px) was too small. Use the html tag to override.

```
<q style="margin-left:140px;">The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</q>

```

## Adding a footer

From Ramnath's user2014 tutorial, slide 30

change `layout/slide.html`

```
<slide class="{{ slide.class }}">
  <hgroup>
    {{{ slide.header }}}
  </hgroup>
  <article>
    {{{ slide.content }}}  
   <footer class = 'logo'>
      <img src = 'path/to/logo'></img>
   </footer>
  </article>
</slide>
```
 
## Making a reproducible, custom theme.

Once one gets a set of changes that we would like
 to recycle, one can always make a new copy of
 ``io2012`` in the ``[R-HOME]/library/slidifyLibraries/libraries/frameworks/`` directory and incorporate the changes there.
