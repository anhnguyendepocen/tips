# Specimen prep

## Cu
From John Mardinly 2013-06-10

> When Intel first started copper, the TEM labs were borrowing time on
> FIBs that were used for F/A, all with iodine or xenon difluoride. The
> samples that came out of these FIBs tended to be covered with "fur"
> by the time they got to the FIB. What we found was that whenever a
> FIB had ever been used for enhanced etch, it was never again suitable
> for use as a TEM prep tool for copper. This required purchasing new
> FIBs dedicated to TEM prep, something that did not go down well
> with management! However, it did solve the problem. The other
> approach that helped a lot was vacuum storage of the specimens.
> We purchased a Gatan unit, specially designed for specimen storage.
> It used the vacuum system of the model 655 specimen holder.
> You can see the design on their web page. This worked well
> for some time. However, a word of caution: You MUST change the
> rubber diaphragms annually, without fail. If the diaphragms
> develop cracks, it will back stream sulphur containing motor
> oil into the system, contaminating everything and corroding
> the copper. Our $17,000 system had to be scrapped because
> the molecular drag pump was contaminated, and it could not
> be successfully cleaned.

> My experience with the nightmare of copper returned after
> Intel closed in Santa Clara, and I moved to Western Digital
> Media R&D. Some experimental disks contained a layer of
> copper. Before we had our own FIB, we had all of our samples
> prepared by a local vendor of TEM services. On a few
> occasions, their weekend shift used an 855 (with enhanced
> etch installed but not used) just to do the lift out
> and glue the 1 micron lamellae to the copper grids. They
> were then finished in a new Helios. By the time they
> got to the TEM, they were destroyed. I knew what the
> problem was right away, but nobody believed me.
> Eventually, they came to accept the idea that copper
> could never go into a FIB with enhanced etch installed,
> whether it was being used or not. Unmeasurable traces
> of that stuff just destroy copper TEM samples.
