These are tips on effective scientific research collected by John Minter from selected web sources.

### William Shockley on what makes an effective researcher
[Brian McGill](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/william-shockley-on-what-makes-a-person-write-a-lot-of-papers-and-the-superstar-researcher-system/) has a nice summary on Shockley's view of research. He used publication as a metric and noted the factors that were required:

1. ability to think of a good problem
2. ability to work on it
3. ability to recognize a worthwhile result
4. ability to make a decision as to when to stop and write up the results
5. ability to write adequately
6. ability to profit constructively from criticism
7. determination to submit the paper to a journal
8. persistence in making changes (if necessary as a result of journal action).

Shockley then posits, what if the odds of a person clearing hurdle ``i`` from the list of 8 above is $p_i$? Then the rate of publishing papers for this individual should be proportional to $p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}\dots p_{8}$. This gives the multiplication of random variables needed to explain the lognormal distribution of productivity (Shockley goes on to note that if one person is 50% above average in each of the 8 areas then they will be 2460% more productive than average at the total process).

Another conclusion is that if you are really bad at just one factor ($p_{i}$ close to zero for just one $i$), it sinks your overall productivity. This is innate in the multiplicative model. This is a solid rationale for working on one's weakest required skill before enhancing one's best requirement - or at least collaborating with those skills who complement yours.
