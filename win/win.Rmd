Some useful tips for windows

## A setup for Win7/WinXP compatibility

1. On WinXP, create ``C:\Users\userName`` for each user. Create a ``Documents`` folder there. Change ``My Documents`` to point there. This is the default for Win7. We will use this as the user's ``%HOME%`` directory on both systems.

2. Create ``git``, ``work``, and ``src`` directories in each users ``Documents``. Create a ``proj`` directory in ``work``. 

3. Place shared dlls/scripts in ``C:\Apps\local``

4. Install Apps like analySIS, R, texlive, etc that tou would like to play well across systems call frequently from the system path into a folder in ``C:\Apps``. Avoid spaces in path names was much as possible. Short is good!!!

## Enabling cut/paste w mouse from cmd window

[MS Technet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff758104.aspx) notes that one can enable copy/paste with the mouse by enabling ``QuickEdit Mode`` in the default command window properties. See also [howto geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/copy-to-the-clipboard-from-the-windows-command-prompt/)

## Poster printing

To use the poster printer in the 8th floor site office

1. **Queue:** ``\\rocps003\PLT4022``
2. Works well with Adobe Reader. Go to ``page setup``
3. **Paper Choice** ``Oversize B0(JIS)``
4. **Paper Source:** Check before use. Typically ``Roll 1`` is satin, ``Roll 2`` is glossy.
5. Make sure you choose best quality - it is slow; typucally takes 20 min for a typical poster.

## Re-assigning drive letters

From [superuser.com](http://superuser.com/questions/70295/force-a-usb-device-to-use-a-certain-drive-letter?rq=1)

1. Start | Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Computer Management
2. Click on "Disk Management"
3. Select the USB drive in the list
4. Right-click and "Change Drive Letters and Paths..."
5. Assign a different, unused drive letter.

## Getting short path names

This one had me ripping my hair out. The solution was
[here](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/522710.html)


There's a simple way to do it:

run ``cmd.exe`` and do the following:
```
cd "long path name"
command
```
Then ``command.com`` will come up and display the short path name.
