### Go Native conference
The [Going Native 2013](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013) Conference had some great keynotes. I enjoyed the presentations by [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Opening-Keynote-Bjarne-Stroustrup) and [Herb Sutter](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Keynote-Herb-Sutter-One-Cpp). Sutter had a great example of Planetary built using the Cinder lib by a self-taught programmer with a degree in sculpture. Planetary received an award at Cannes and is the first program to be archived by the Smithsonian.  

### Cinder
