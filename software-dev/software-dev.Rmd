# Technical Debt

Key comments by
[Gordon Shotwell](https://blog.shotwell.ca/posts/2019-04-19-technical-debt-in-data-science/)
from an article published **2019-04-19**:

> Here are a couple of questions to help identify if you have a problem with
> this kind of technical debt:
> 
> - Do you have time and resources to write tests, refactor code, or review
>   the code of your colleagues?
>
> - Do you know the limits of your code base, in other words can you say
>   clearly what parts of your code need to be maintained
>
> - Do you know what your test coverage is for this codebase?
>
> - Do you get and respond to feedback about whether your code is easy
>   to understand?
>
> If you answered "no" to these questions there's a good chance you are taking
> on dangerous technical debt. Not only are you trading today's work for
> tomorrow, but you **_can't know_** how much future work you're committing
> to. The technical debt sits like a time bomb somewhere in your code base,
> and you don't know when it will go off or what damage it will cause.

> **How to fix this**
>
> - Look through your code base and ask "do I care if this code is correct
>    include tests for all such code.
>
> - Start writing **smaller**, **_simpler_ functions**. These are easier to test.
>   When other developers ask you to refactor or extend their code,
>   **insist that it includes tests**. **Do _not_ trust people** when they
>   **_say_** the code is correct. **Insist** that they define what correctness
>   means.
>
> - Make an **_organizational policy_** that **tasks _aren't complete_** until
>   **they are tested**.
