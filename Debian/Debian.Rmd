# Introduction

[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) is a free Linux operating system that is
related to Ubuntu. Most common hardware is supported. Get it
[**here**](https://www.debian.org/distrib/). Documentation is
[**here**](https://www.debian.org/doc/). Installation guides are
[**here**](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual).

# Mirrors

Mirror status: [here](https://mirror-master.debian.org/status/mirror-status.html)

I like columbia best - much faster than rit.
The two choices I have in
`/etc/apt/sources.list` are:

```
# deb http://mirror.rit.edu/debian/ stretch main
# deb-src http://mirror.rit.edu/debian/ stretch main

# Columbia does not seem to be updating 2019-03-02
deb http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/debian/ stretch main
deb-src http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/debian/ stretch main

# Binghamton updated as of 2019-03-02
deb http://debian.cs.binghamton.edu/debian/ stretch main
deb-src http://debian.cs.binghamton.edu/debian/ stretch main

```


# Updates

## From the command line

See `man apt-get`.

```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

To overide mirror warnings

```
sudo apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false update
sudo apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false upgrade
```

To update the distribution

```
apt-get dist-upgrade
```

# Admin tasks

## Add a user to sudo

From the command line:

1. Go to home directory by running command `cd $HOME`

2. Type `su -`. It will ask you for password. Type the
root user password. You will then be the root user.

3. Type `visudo`

4. Using the editor, add

   ```
   username (tab) ALL=(ALL) (tab) ALL
   ```

   to the sudoers file. Save (`write out`) and `exit`.

This was adapted from the answer by by Shrikant Khawale on 
[stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/179954/username-is-not-in-the-sudoers-file-this-incident-will-be-reported).

## Adding minicondaa

1. Download the latest [installer](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh).

2. Make the shell script executable (`chmod +x *.sh`).

3. Install to `/home/jrminter/Apps/miniconda3`.

4. Answer `yes` to initialize in `.bashrc`.

5. Open a new terminal.

    Add:
    
    ```
    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyter spyder
    conda install sqlite pandas xlwt scikit-image
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install mahotas
    conda install sympy
    conda install cython
    pip install iversions
    
    ```
