# Admin tasks

## Add a user to sudo

From the command line:

1. Go to home directory by running command `cd $HOME`

2. Type `su -`. It will ask you for password. Type the
root user password. You will then be the root user.

3. Type `visudo`

4. Using the editor, add

   ```
   username (tab) ALL=(ALL) (tab) ALL
   ```

   to the sudoers file. Save (`write out`) and `exit`.

This was adapted from the answer by by Shrikant Khawale on
