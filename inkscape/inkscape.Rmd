# Fast Tips

## Trouble with text not showing up.

The site
[www.inkscapeforum.com](http://www.inkscapeforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=25142)
offered this helpful solution:

> Flowed text won't show up on the internet. Convert back to regular text:    
> **Text menu `>` Convert to text**. You might have to realign.
