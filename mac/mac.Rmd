# Startup items
## global environment variables
If one has global environment variables to set at
launch time and be avaible to all applications (that
might note get them from ``.profile``) one can put
them in ``/etc/launchd.conf``. An example might be

```
setenv IMG_ROOT /Users/jrminter/dat/images
```

Note how this uses ``csh`` syntax...

## Personal environment variables
These are best set in ``.profile``



# Hardware tips
## Eject a stuck CD/DVD
1. Restart the computer. If necessary, use the reset/interrupt
button.
2. Immediately after the system startup tone, press and
hold the ``CMD-OPT-O-F`` key combination. The computer starts
up to a text-only screen, indicating that you are in
Open Firmware.
3. At the prompt, type ``eject cd`` and return.
4. At the prompt, type ``mac-boot`` and return.
