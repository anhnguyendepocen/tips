# Defining a custom material

It is important to add a name when one define a name when defining a
custom material that will be used with the MC3 simulations. Here is an
example for PET

```
pet = epq.Material(epq.Composition([epq.Element.C,epq.Element.H,epq.Element.O],[0.62502,0.04196,0.069042]),epq.ToSI.gPerCC(1.37))
pet.setName("PET")
```

# System Admin

## Preferences

On Windows, preferences are stored in the registry. The base key is:

```
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\gov]
```
It is always useful to export this as a `.reg` file.

On MacOSX, preferences are stored in a `.plist` file...

```
~/Library/Preferences/gov.nist.microanalysis.plist
```


# Getting NISTMonte Monte Carlo packages to work with Iona and Jupiter

DTSA-II Iona seems to not export classes that were available
in Halley. I noticed that the `mcSimulate3.py` file had these
curious lines at the top:

```
import sys
sys.packageManager.makeJavaPackage("gov.nist.microanalysis.NISTMonte.Gen3", "CharacteristicXRayGeneration3, BremsstrahlungXRayGeneration3, FluorescenceXRayGeneration3, XRayTransport3", None)
```

Note: it does **not** like the lines to be split...

I did a Google search  and found
[this](http://sourceforge.net/p/jython/mailman/message/6725556/)
explanation: The following code works with Jython launched from the jar in the standard install:

```
import java.awt
f = java.awt.Frame()
f.title = "Hello AWT"
f.visible = True
```

but when run with `Jython.jar` from the standalone install
the code gives

```
>java -jar jython.jar
Jython 2.2b1 on java1.6.0 (JIT: null)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import java.awt
Traceback (innermost last):
  File "", line 1, in ?
ImportError: no module named awt
>>> ^Z
```

WORKROUND

You need to nudge the system to do what caching would have done:-

```
import sys
sys.packageManager.makeJavaPackage("java.awt", "Window", None)
import java.awt
f = java.awt.Frame()
f.title = "Hello AWT"
f.visible = True
```
