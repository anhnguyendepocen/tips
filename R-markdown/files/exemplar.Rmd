# Smoothing in gnuplot

On page 45 in `Gnuplot in Action, 2nd ed.`, Philip Janert supplies the
helpful table below. He writes:

> Gnuplot can construct a variety of smooth curves as representations of a
> data set. You can invoke this feature using the smooth directive to the plot
> command, followed by an additional keyword that selects the specific interpolation
> method. Table 3.4 lists the available smoothing methods, together with brief
> descriptions.


```{r read_csv, echo=FALSE}
path <- paste0(here(), "/csv/gnuplot_table_3pt4.csv")
# print(path)

df <- read.csv(file=path, header=TRUE, sep=",")
kable(df)
```
