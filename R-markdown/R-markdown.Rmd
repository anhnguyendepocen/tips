# Overview

**R-markdown** is a powerful light-weight formatting language that enables the
author to generate attractive documents that are stored in plain text files
that are compatible with version control. This works very well in the
**RStudio** environment.

Some key resources are the
[RStudio Intro to rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), 
the RStudio Intro to Pandoc
[markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html),
and for $\LaTeX$ math, the
[AOPS](http://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LaTeX:Commands) site.

# Key HTML and Unicode characters


```
mu  &#x393; or &mu; Can use &Mu; for capital. 
    Unicode is \U00B5 (micro) and \U039c (upper) \U03BC (lower)
    
phi &Phi; or &phi; or \U03D5 (lower) \U03A6 (upper)

rho &Rho; or &rho; or \UO3C1 (lower) \U03A1 (upper)

A-ring: &#8491;  or \U212B

degree &#176; or \U00B0

```

# YAML

**YAML** is an abbreviation for "Yet Another Markup Language". 
R-markdown uses YAML to encode information for later steps in the document
generation process. Each document begins with a YAML header. 
This is an example of a YAML header for an analysis. Note how the \% 
character is escaped. Also note the $\LaTeX$ expression.

title: "SEM/EDS analysis of qm-05000-SampleID"
author: "J. R. Minter"
date: "December 7, 2016"
abstract: |
  The particles were deposited on a Si chip and lightly C coated. The 
  morphology appeared to be a mixture of small needles and small equiaxial
  nanoparticles. Clumps seemed to be particles embedded in a film.
  
  Analysis of EDS spectra revealed an atomic fraction of $\dfrac{Al}{Al+Zn}$
  of 3-4\%.
output:
  knitr:::html_vignette:
    css: ../theme/jm-mod-vignette.css
    number_sections: yes
    toc: yes
    bibliography: bibliography.bib

```

Note that one can generate the date and time at document generation time by
using an R chunk in the YAML header.

by putting the R expression:

    r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')
    
in the blank area below (I had to enter this way or it would compile...)

    date: "`    `"

to create the YAML entry...


# Custom themes

The easiest way to make a custom theme is to modify an existing one.
I modified the R vignette theme.

# Controlling image size

We can get fine control of image size like this:

1. Start by adding these packages to the first R chunk

```
library(png)
library(grid)
library(rEDS)
```

2. Include an image in a R chunk like this:

```
img <- readPNG("../path-to/foo.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

3. The header for the R-chunk might include

```
r fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5.625, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',
fig.cap='ImgName. 7 kV 1,000X'
```

4. I compute the fig.height from the desired width (7.5 in) and the image
   dimensions using R. For a 1024/768 image, one gets:
   
```
> 7.5*768/1024
[1] 5.625
```

# Citations

See [Citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)

At end of document add

```
last paragraph...

# References
```

Then a citation like:

```
Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].
```

A minus sign (-) before the @ will suppress mention of the author in the citation. This can be useful when the author is already mentioned in the text:

```
Smith says blah [-@smith04].
```

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

```
@smith04 says blah.

@smith04 [p. 33] says blah.
```
