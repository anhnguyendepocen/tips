# Introduction

This document contains tips to help Beth build equipment for her Earth Science
class.

# Wave table

Beth wanted to build a wave table for her class. From 2019-03-16 to 2019-03-19
we tried a prototype we decided to name `Slosh`. It was an experience. Beth
bought the material with a plan in mind. The table was based on a piece of
2x12 pine (1.75x11.75 in) cut to 6 feet long. This was a sturdy but heavy base.
We had some nice Dutch plywood from a TEM crate that served as sides.

Beth had purchased two pieces of plexiglass 36x12x0.125 in for the front.
She purchased a 2x4 pine board from which we cut upright cleats (2x42)
for the ends to which we could fasten the plywood using 2 in drywall screws.
The drywall screws were hard to completely countersink.  In the future, I think
0.75 in marine grade plywood would be better. We could cut dados in the ends and
use waterproof wood glue and finishing nails from our nail gun to assemble the
tank carcass.

I mounted the plexiglass on the front by first drilling pilot holes and then
using drywall screws. The 1/8 in plexiglass had a tendency to crack. The drywall
screws protruded. I think it would be better to have a marine plywood frame with
a cutout for the plexiglass (I'd prefer a single sheet) that could be mounted in
dados in the plywood cutout. The plexiglass could be held in by small wooden
cleats screwed into the face frame.

We made inserts for each end: 1) a "beach" for the waves to hit and then a board
mounted on the other end to be used to generate waves.

We sealed all the wood with a wood stai/sealer and caulked all the joints and
screws with silicone caulk.

# Other ideas

1. [oceanservice.noaa.gov](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/pd/tidescurrents/applications/oilspill_model_lesson.html)
has a plan for a simple wave table in `Appendix A`.

They suggest:

> **Easy build / view Ocean table**
> 
> **Materials**
> 
> 1. Large rectangular clear plastic tray/tub ~2' x 3' though other larger size
> may be substituted (the tray should be at least 1' deep).    
> 2. Hose and coupling to attach to tray
> 3. Water source - a tap is best though water can be added through a funnel
> and buckets of water.
> 4. One 20 lb bag of white aquarium sand
> 5. Small mesh screens or cheese cloth
> 6. Bucket or sink to collect drained water
> 7. Grease pencils
> 8. Video-still camera
>
> Large rectangular clear plastic tub - one that is ~2' x 3' x 1' deep works
> well. Hoses for running water can be attached at both ends to help facilitate
> constant water flow. The down stream hose should be attached 1" from the
> bottom on one end of the plastic tub. A fine mesh screen or cheesecloth should
> be placed over the opening on the "out" hose to prevent sand from being washed
> out.
> 
> 1. Fill tub with white sand along one of the short ends, as deep as possible
> (the sand will have a tendency to slide down. This will serve as the shoreline
> beach.
> 
> 2. Use toy houses, cars, boats, or an oil rig for authenticity.
> Hint: a stream will form outward from the "in flow" hose.
>
>
> 3. Fill the bottom with 6 inches of water. The ocean end can be placed on a board
> that acts as a lever and allows you to lift the ocean end to simulate tides on
> the beach.
> 
> 4. Slowly turn on hose and allow it to trickle water through the system. You
> can monitor the flow rate by observing how much water flows out of the system.
> The flow rate should be fast enough not to disturb the beach sand too much.
>
> 5. Once the tub is filled, use a dropper, filled with vegetable oil and red
> food coloring in one spot in the middle of the ocean. A clear plastic tub will
> allow students to view the side distribution of the pollution plume.
> 
> 6. Dispersal of pollutants can be viewed through the side of clear plastic
> tubs, and marked with grease pencil. If the stream table is visible form the
> bottom then dispersal of pollutants can be viewed from that angle. Or a video
> camera or can be used to display the bottom of the tub.
> 
> 7. A current will naturally be created by the water flow from the in flow to
> the out flow hose but to add additional currents a board, or even a dust pan
> can be used to circulate the pollution plume in other directions. The
> pollution will eventually reach the beach through eddy currents forming on
> the sides of the tube induced by the natural current but an artificial long
> shore current can also be added by carefully pushing surface water parallel
> to the shoreline. Long shore currents can also be created by attaching an
> additional in flow hose on one side of the tub near the beach.
> 
> 8. To generate waves that strike the beach, an additional floating piece of
> 2" x 4" wood in the ocean can be used. Note the additional changes that this
> action produces on dispersing the pollutants.
>
> 9. This model is a one-time use model. Once the sand and water become largely
> discolored and the water changes tint, you should empty, rinse and clean the
> sand (or replace) to get the same visual effects in subsequent experiments.
> Video-photographs-sketches of the progression of the pollutants will help pos
