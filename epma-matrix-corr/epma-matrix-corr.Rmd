  Inclusion of unanalyzed elements affects the totals in analyzed
  elements as they are added to the matrix correction of a hydrous
  glass.
  
  The lesson is always include all the unanalyzed elements into the
  matrix correction, or you will have significant errors in the analyzed
  elements.  Excel is great, but it doesn't know physics!.

Since I mentioned the effect of not including water by difference as it affects the matrix correction in my JEOL Listserver post,
I will "show my work" as to how the various unanalyzed elements affects the analyzed elements, as they are added to the matrix
correction of a hydrous glass. For a publication reference see
[this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00445-005-0003-z) paper.

In this example I selected an experimental glass from Withers, which nominally contains 4.9 wt.% H~2~O, but FTIR showed 5.06 wt%.
Here is the analysis of this glass as an unknown with nothing but the analyzed elements:

If we calculate the above elemental analysis as oxide formulas (but still without oxygen included in the matrix correction), we get
the following results:

Note that total is much better, but the SiO~2~ concentration is only 65.8 wt.%.  Now we will recalculate the glass but this time include
stoichiometric oxygen in the matrix correction:

Please note that by including the stoichiometric oxygen in the matrix correction the SiO~2~ concentration went from 65.8 wt.% to 70.09 wt.%.
This is because oxygen absorbs Si Ka more than Si.  So without stoichiomtric oxygen in the matrix correction, the matrix is anomalously
high in Si, which again, does not absorb Si Ka as much as oxygen, so the matrix correction for Si is underestimated.

But we still have a total of only 91.1 wt.%, so one might be forgiven to estimate the water by difference as 8.9 wt.%.  But one would be
wrong because we haven't provided a correction for the ion migration of Na and the effect on the other elements. The TDI correction for
Na in this glass is around 100% as seen here in this plot of log intensity vs. time:

So turning on the TDI correction we obtain these analyses:

Note that the Na concentration went from around 2.2 wt% to 4.4 wt.%, but the Si dropped slightly because the TDI effect on Si is usually
an increase in intensity as the Na intensity drops due to ion migration under the electron beam.

Now based on our totals of around 93.4 wt.%, our water by difference estimate would be around 6.6 wt.%, but that isn't very close to the
FTIR H~2~O measurement of 5.06 wt.%. So what's going on?  Well we have not yet included the water by difference into the matrix correction.

Once we do that we obtain these results:

Note that our SiO~2~ concentration went up slightly because we added additional oxygen (from H~2~O) into the matrix calculation, and so now our
water by difference is around 5.7 wt.% which is quite close to our FTIR value of 5.06 wt.%.  If we had included other trace elements in the
analysis, we would get even closer.

So, the lesson is, always include all the unanalyzed elements into the matrix correction, or you will have significant errors in the analyzed
elements.  Excel is great, but it doesn't know physics!  Please let me know if anyone has any questions.
