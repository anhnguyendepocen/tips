MSYS2 is a software distribution and building platform for Windows.
The installer is available from the [Home Page](http://www.msys2.org/).
The current release cannot be installed on a FAT partition and
no longer supports Windows XP.

There is a Wiki on [github](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki).

MSYS2 uses **pacman** as a package manager. To find a specific package
in the repository (and that package can or cannot be installed on your
machine) you can use the following command:

> `pacman -Ss <name or part of the name of the package>`

Example:

> `$ pacman -Ss python`
