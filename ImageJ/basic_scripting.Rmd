# Introduction

We will use the images that I downloaded and installed in the `./tif`
directory. We will use the
[Scripting Slides](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-scripting/#/).
There are active links in the slides.

The video is [here](https://vimeo.com/218520432). I will include time stamps
for the exercises.

Ellen Arena is a postoc at [LOCI](https://loci.wisc.edu/). She is one of the
maintainers of ImageJ.

(6:00)
Scripts help with documenting our work. Ellen thinks of them as her
lab notebook for computation. By adding comments you cna record what you did
and why. The "what" is the code; the notes are the "why" (and your observations).
You always want to think about "down the road." I recall Karl Broman:

> Your closest collaborator is you, six months from now. And you don't respond
> to email...

Ask yourself:

> When you read it again, can you replicate it?

We all want to automate our analyses to avoid unneeded repetition and to have
reproducible analyses. And you want to share your work...

# The macro recorder

The macro recorder is built into Fiji/ImageJ. The recorder saves the steps in a
text file. You can record in multiple languages


- Use "l" to get the command finder and type `record` and select the
`Record...` entry and press `Run`. This starts the recorder.

  ![Macro recorder languages (8:45)](png/recorder_languages.png) 
  
  All the scripts today will be in the ImageJ macro language. it is not the most
  powerful language but it is a good place to start in ImageJ.
  
  Opening the `Blobs` sample image produces `run("Blobs (25K)");`. Note that
  threshold commands are recorded, even the check box togggles. (9:55)
  
  Creating a mask produces `run("Create Mask");`. Each step is recorded.
  
# The plan

1. Close the recorder
2. Read in one of the images using Bioformats importer to preserve metadata
3. Open image 5.
4. Switch LUT to Gray
5. Now open the recorder (`Record...`this prevents hard-coding opening images),
   Make sure we are recording in the macro language (12:35).
6. Do the following:
   - Gaussian Blur with sigma=2
   - Run Threshold, use the default with a dark background
   - Create a mask
   - Run a Watershed
   - Run `Analyze Particles` with size from 2000 to infinity, exclude edges,
     and add to ROI manager
   - Press `Create` to send the commands to the Script Manager
   - Make sure the language is `ImageJ Macro`. Note that more languages
     are available:
   
     ![Languages available and syntax coloring.](png/languages_available.png)
   - Our code looks like this (19:13)
    
     ```
     run("Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=2");
     //run("Threshold...");
     setAutoThreshold("Default dark");
     run("Create Mask");
     run("Watershed");
     run("Analyze Particles...", "size=2000-Infinity exclude add");
     ```
     
     It is a good start. Now we "fix it up"
     
     
# Introduction to Script Parameters (20:47)

1. We edit, adding a script parameter
   
    ```
    // @int(label = "Minimum size px") minSize
    run("Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=2");
    //run("Threshold...");
    setAutoThreshold("Default dark");
    run("Create Mask");
    run("Watershed");
    run("Analyze Particles...", "size=" + minSize + "-Infinity exclude add");
    ```
    
    We re-open image with Bioformats
    
    Variable names **are case-sensitive**! (28:29)

# Storing Macros

- From script editor, save the .ijm file in Fiji.app/scripts/Plugins
(note the capital P).

- We can also group scripts in subfolders of Plugins (37:17)
  I saved this as `Nuclei_Count.ijm` in `/Applications/Fiji.app/scripts/Plugins`.

- Close and re-open Fiji to have it find the script

   ![Note that they are found at the bottom](png/plug_ins_at_bottom.png)

**_Nota Bene_:** Save copies of your scripts in a git repository because if you
have to reinstall Fiji, you might lose your scripts!!!! (39:09).

Remember the code for this example is
[here](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-scripting/#/4/4).

and reproduced below:

```
#@int(label = "Minimum size") minSize

setBatchMode(true);
id = getImageID(); // get original image id
run("Duplicate...", " "); // duplicate original image and work on the copy
run("Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=2");
setAutoThreshold("Default dark");
//run("Threshold...");
run("Create Mask");
run("Watershed");
run("Analyze Particles...", "size=" + minSize + "-Infinity display exclude add");
run("Clear Results"); // delete contents of results table
selectImage(id); // activate original image
roiManager("Show All with labels"); // overlay ROIs
roiManager("Deselect");
roiManager("Measure"); // measure on original image
```

# More on the Script Editor

(Starting at 40:02) - stop for night...
