I had recorded an image on the Olympus BX-16 microscope at 10X. The metadata
from the original image is shown below.

![Metadata from SIS Viewer](tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro.png)

The image (reduced to 8 bits/pix) is shown below.

![The image reduced to 8 bits per pixel. One large divison is $100\ \mu m$.](tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro-cal-ori.png)

After cropping the image to measure just the large divisons and applying an
automatic threshold to segment the lines I obtained the image below.

An enlarged view of the first two lines is shown below.

The measurement data was stored to a `.csv` file for analysis.

Let's read in the data

```{r read_csv_file}

df <-read.csv2("tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro.csv", sep=',')
library(knitr)
kable(df)

```

Note that the area of the last measurement is 1 pixel. This is spurious. We need
to filter out the last row.

We can do this using base R as shown below


```{r filterData, comment=NA}
df_good <- df[df$Area>1,]
kable(df_good)
```
