I had recorded an image on the Olympus BX-16 microscope at 10X. The metadata
from the original image is shown below.

![Metadata from SIS Viewer](tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro.png)

The image (reduced to 8 bits/pix) is shown below.

![The image reduced to 8 bits per pixel. One large divison is $100\ \mu m$.](tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro-cal-ori.png)

After cropping the image to measure just the large divisons and applying an
automatic threshold to segment the lines I obtained the image below.

An enlarged view of the first two lines is shown below.

The measurement data was stored to a `.csv` file for analysis.

Let's read in the data

```{r read_csv_file}

df <-read.csv2("tif/stage-micrometer/BX61-10X-1-AO-micro.csv", sep=',', stringsAsFactors =FALSE)
library(knitr)
kable(df)

```

Note that the area of the last measurement is 1 pixel. This is spurious. We need
to filter out the last row.

We can do this using base R as shown below


```{r filterData, comment=NA}
df_good <- df[df$Area>1,]
kable(df)
```

All we really need is the `XM` columnm, so we can run

```{r get_diff, comment=NA}

df <- df[df$Area>1,]
xm <- as.numeric(df$XM)
xm
```

Note the last value is unusual...

```{r calc_diff, comment=NA}

delta_xm <- diff(xm)
delta_xm
```

Yes, the last value is spurious...

```{r delete_last, comment=NA}
delta_xm <- delta_xm[1:9]
delta_xm
```

These look as expected. However, they are in units of `px/100 microns`. We really
want `microns/px`, so we do a transformation

```{r transform, comment=NA}

px_per_um <- 100.0/delta_xm
px_per_um
```

```{r calc_stats, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
library(dplyr)
med <- median(px_per_um)
std_dev <- sd(px_per_um)

df_px_per_um <- as_tibble(data.frame(statistic=c("median", "std_dev"),
                                 px_per_um=round(c(med, std_dev),4)))
kable(df_px_per_um)
```
