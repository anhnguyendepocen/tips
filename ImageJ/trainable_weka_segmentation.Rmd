# Itroduction

This example came from a
[Forum post](https://forum.image.sc/t/analysis-of-aggregates/303)
by a user who was having difficulties segmenting the image below.
Ellen Arena used this as an example in this 
[video](https://vimeo.com/218520761#t=1h11m44s).

Ellen explains the difficulties:

1. We can see the aggregates and can also see that there is a shadow from the
micro-wells that could cause a problem. There is also a shadow across the image.
It is darker in the upper left.... 

2. The user trains the system with part of your input data, teaching the
classifier  what to segment. The results may be applied to multiple images.
The user benefis from the algorithms included in the package.

3. The output is a labeled result based on the data training set used to train
the model.

# The problem explained

The user explains the problem:

> I seeded cells in microwells to measure the difference in aggregation.
> Pictures were taken through a microscope. Now I want to analyse the size of
> the aggregates. Therefore I want to **outline the clump of cells** then to be
> able to anlyse them. I have to repeat this for every clump in the picture.
> (I have many many more pictures to go through...) I started drawing the
> outlines with the freehand tool (JRM: **ugh!**), but I would want to automate
> this process. **The wand tool is way too rough and unprecise**.
> I’m still a beginner, I have not much of a clue how imageJ exactly works.
> (JRM: an honest user...) If someone of you could help me further, I’d be
> incredibly grateful.

# Trainable Weka proposed

Jan Eglinger suggests an approach that uses
[Trainable Weka Segmentation](https://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation)

In in Fiji one finds it in:

> ```
> Plugins > Segmentation > Trainable Weka Segmentation
> ```

Jan tried and got the following result:

using

# Curtis Reuden summarizes the approach

# Ellen Arena walks us through the steps

1. Load the image

2. Start `Trainable weka Segmentation`

3. We will have two labels: `cells` and `not-cells`

4. Open `Settings` (lower left corner)

5. Set the settings. The image below shows the current choices selected

    ![Settings for this exemplar](png/jrm_tw_settings.png)
    
    Note one odd feature. When I save (on the mac) a screen shot of the 
    Weka window
    
6. Run the classifier. The image below shows the segmentation
