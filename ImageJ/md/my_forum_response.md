Take a look at the following links and they will help you get started:

- The [Segmentation](http://imagej.net/Segmentation) page of the [ImageJ Wiki](http://imagej.net/)

- The [Segmentation in Fiji](https://vimeo.com/218520761#t=1h05m49s) workshop and the
corresponding [slides](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/2017-05/fiji-segmentation/#/). Ellen Arena did a superb job presenting (and I think Curtis Reuden was heavily involved making the slides). More recently updated slides are [here](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-segmentation/#/).

- The [Scripting](http://imagej.net/Scripting) overview page on the Wiki.

- The [Introduction into Macro Programming](http://imagej.net/Introduction_into_Macro_Programming)
page of the Wiki.

- [Built-In Macro Functions list](http://imagej.net/developer/macro/functions.html)

I use the Fiji Script editor along with the Macro recorder. It lets you run selected lines to see that everything works up to the line that fails. Then one learns how to interpret the results...

The Fiji/ImageJ community is helpful. If you run into problems be sure to upload a test image that you used and the macro code.  To include code here put it between lines that start with three back-tics (under the tilde on many keyboards)

Best wishes as you start on this journey to make reproducible analyses with Fiji/ImageJ.
