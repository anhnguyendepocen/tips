There is no macro that does exactly this... You'll have to script one yourself.  But that shouldnâ€™t be a problem.  Just take a look at the following links and you'll be well on your way:

- The [Segmentation](http://imagej.net/Segmentation) page of the [ImageJ Wiki](http://imagej.net/)

- The [Segmentation in Fiji](https://vimeo.com/218520761#t=1h05m49s) workshop and the
corresponding[slides](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/2017-05/fiji-segmentation/#/).
More recently updated slides are [here](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/fiji-segmentation/#/)

- The [Scripting](http://imagej.net/Scripting) overview page on the Wiki

- The [Introduction into Macro Programming](http://imagej.net/Introduction_into_Macro_Programming)
page of the Wiki.

- [Built-In Macro Functions list](http://imagej.net/developer/macro/functions.html)

The workshops are the best thing to work through...
