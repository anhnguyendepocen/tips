# Introduction


Jan Eglinger (imagejan on the forum.image.sc) is a proponent of Groovy
for understandable scripting in Fiji/ImageJ. He wrote:

The main site for Groovy is [groovy-lang.org](http://groovy-lang.org/).

There is a [Groovy Scripting](https://imagej.net/Groovy_Scripting) page on
ImageJ.net that refers to the Groovy
[Getting Started](http://groovy-lang.org/documentation.html#gettingstarted)
page.

[Groovy Syntax](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html)

I had a **_terrible_** time installing Groovy on my Win 7 system (crunch).
I could not get the installer file to choose a 64 bit java and when it
used my 32 bit JDK the program crashed on start up.

I ended using the brute force approach: I downloaded the
[zip file](https://dl.bintray.com/groovy/maven/apache-groovy-binary-2.5.7.zip)
unzipped it and installed it in `C:/Apps/groovy\groovy-2.5.7`
(I 7-zipped the installation and
stored it in`Dropbox/groovy/groovy-2.5.7.7z` I created a batch file
`start_groovy_console.bat`
that I install in `C:/Apps/local/path`. I created a Windows shortcut
`start_groovy_console` that sits on my desktop. It works...

I have a simple groovy script [here](groovy/gaussian_blur.groovy) that uses
a 32 bit image of my [head shot](groovy/john_32.png).
