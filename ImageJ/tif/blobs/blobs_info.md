# blobs image information

Meijster *et al.* in Figure 4 report that the images are gold particles.

I (John Minter) suspect that these are transmission or scanning transmission
electron micrographs. This is a **_very_ popular image**. We really need one
with better sample provenance.

I constructed the blobs.tif image by creating a tif file from the .gif
file and creating a standard 8 bit/px grayscale image in Fiji/ImageJ.
