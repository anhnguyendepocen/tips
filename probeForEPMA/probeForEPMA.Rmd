Probe for EPMA is a commercial EPMA software package with demo packages,
especially CalcZAF. I have long term interest. 

# Getting started

There is a good [Getting Started with CalcZAF](http://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=81.msg292#msg292)
by John Donovan on the Probe Software Forum.


**Getting help**: Access the the Probe for EPMA User Reference manual by hitting the **F1** key in CalcZAF. **Note:** Win 10 does **not** support
the old style **.hlp** files. The easiest thing to do is to copy
**win32help.exe** from an old WinXP box to someplace in your path.
**Caution:** these .hlp files are not secure, so only use files from
sources you trust.

# Calculation optionss

Note the main CalcZAF screen layout below.

![The CalcZAF main screen. Note the four computation options in the radio buttons near the body of the screen.](./img/MainScreenCalcZAF.png)

Note that one can write input files (.dat) for each of these modes.
Examples are shown below. Note that **each** of these assumes the
example is the **first entry** in the **.dat** file (hence the first 0).

## Basic Input - Pseudo Code example

First some hints:

Note 1:

```
CalcMode% = 0 for calculation of k-ratios from concentrations
CalcMode% = 1 for calculation of concentrations from unknown and standard intensities
CalcMode% = 2 for calculation of concentrations from "raw" k-ratios (no standard intensities necessary)
CalcMode% = 3 for calculation of concentrations from "normalized" k-ratios (no standards necessary)
```

Note 2:

```
OxideorElemental%=1 calculate oxide output based on stoichiometry
OxideorElemental%=2 calculate as elemental output (default)
```



**Note 3:** all strings (element symbols, etc.) must be in double
quotes, elements not analyzed (specified concentrations or calculated)
are indicated by a blank (empty double quotes) x-ray line string. If
the element is a specified concentration, be sure to give the
concentration in elemental weight percent for the
`"ElmPercents!(I%)"` parameter and leave the count intensity
fields zero.


**Now the pseudo code...**

```
' Read calculation mode (0, 1, 2, or 3), number of elements, 
' kilovolts and takeoff, (optional sample name)
Input #3, CalcMode%, LastChan%, Kilovolts!, Takeoff!, (SampleName$)


' Read oxide/elemental mode, difference, stoichiometry, relative
Input #3, OxideOrElemental%, DifferenceElement$, StoichiometryElement$,  StoichiometryRatio!, RelativeElement$, RelativeToElement$, RelativeRatio!


' Loop on each element
For i% = 1 To LastChan%
   Input #3, Elsyms$(i%), Xrsyms$(i%), NumCat%(i%), NumOxd%(i%), StdAssigns%(i%), ElmPercents!(i%), UnkCounts!(i%), StdCounts!(i%)
next i%

```

# Sysadmin

These are tips for use and
sysadmin.


# Key directories in my install

## preferred install dir

```
C:\Apps\CalcZAF
```

This has programs and some data

## Windows ProgramData

```
C:\ProgramData\Probe Software\Probe for EPMA 
```

**standard.mdb** goes in here, as do update installers. John Donovan
occasionaly updates this file.

## User data

```
C:\UserData
```

Has the following tree with data files

![UserData tree](./img/UserData-tree.png)
 

## UserImages
 
 This would have images from the system
 
 ```
 C:\UserImages
 ```

Currently empty in my installs
