# Introduction

`wxMaxima` is a gui version of the `maxima` computer algebra system. It has a
nice notebook interface. There is a nice set of YouTube videos by
[Andrew Norman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEDEE2F7C6750729F)
outlining its use. The source code for `wxMaxima` is on
[github](https://github.com/andrejv/wxmaxima). There is also a
helpful [website](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/index.html). 

Note that one can install this on MacOSX by

```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install maxima wxmaxima
```

One can also download `Maxima-5.42.2-VTK-macOS.dmg` from
[Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-MacOS/5.42.2-MacOSX/).
This was released `2019-02-05`.

I use the wxMaxima App included in the package (look inside `Maxima.app`).
I configured gnuplot in the `.maxima` folder and zipped up the folder
and put it in Dropbox. This fixed my inital problem when `wxMaxima` got stuck
in full sceen mode. Sometimes it does not like to shut down...


# Issues

1. I had problems with gnuplot (2018-05-21). There is a bug that has not
made it to homebrew. The fix was to add to **~/.maxima/wxmaxima-init**.
This was from: [github](https://github.com/andrejv/wxmaxima/issues/973)

    ```
    wxplot_old_gnuplot:false$
    ```
2. I have had problems on MacOS with the app getting stuck in full screen
mode if I enter something other than `CMD + Return`. The solution is to
remove the `wxMaxima Preferences` file from
`/Users/jrminter/Library/Preferences`. I saved a good one in my 
`Desktop/shortcuts/Maxima` folder.

# File formats

wxMaxima has two storage formats. `.wxmx` files contains results and plot
images. `.wxm` files just contain the input / script.

# Exporting $\LaTeX$ output

I discovered that when one exports the notebook to html, the $\LaTeX$
output has a lot of errors when used in a `.tex` document. The best way
to export the output is to generate a cell like:

```
(%i6) solve(x^3âˆ’3*x+1,x);
```

and then generate the $\LaTeX$ by

```
(%i7) tex(''%i6);
```
then copy the output and paste into the $\LaTeX$ document as shown below.


```
$$\left[ x=\left({{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{2
 }\over{3}}}+\left({{-1}\over{2}}-{{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}\right)\,
 \left({{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{1}\over{3}}}
  , x=\left({{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{4}\over{3
 }}}+{{{{-1}\over{2}}-{{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}}\over{\left({{\sqrt{3}
 \,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{1}\over{3}}}}} , x=\left({{
 \sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{1}\over{3}}}+{{1
 }\over{\left({{\sqrt{3}\,i}\over{2}}-{{1}\over{2}}\right)^{{{1
 }\over{3}}}}} \right] $$
```
