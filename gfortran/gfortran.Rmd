# Changing fortran compilers on MacOSX

The current fortran compiler for MacOSX is
`gfortran-6.1.pkg`.  There is an older version that
may work better for `gmrfilm`.

To remove a package,
[Slashdot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17564543/how-to-uninstall-gfortran-compiler-on-mac-osx-10-7)
recommends 

```
sudo rm -r /usr/local/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran
```
