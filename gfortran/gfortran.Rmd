# Changing fortran compilers on MacOSX

The current fortran compiler for R on MacOSX is
`gfortran-6.1`.  There is an older version    
(`gfortran-5.2-Yosemite.dmg`)
that I thought may might better for `gmrfilm`,
but it did not.

To remove a package,
[Slashdot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17564543/how-to-uninstall-gfortran-compiler-on-mac-osx-10-7)
recommends 

```
sudo rm -r /usr/local/gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran
```
