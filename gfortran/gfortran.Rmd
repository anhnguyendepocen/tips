# Changing fortran compilers on MacOSX

The current fortran compiler for R on MacOSX is
`gfortran-6.1`.  There is an older version    
(`gfortran-5.2-Yosemite.dmg`)
that I thought may might better for `gmrfilm`,
but it did not. Note that this is accompanied by
`clang6` (clang-6.0.0.pkg).

To remove a package,
[Slashdot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17564543/how-to-uninstall-gfortran-compiler-on-mac-osx-10-7) and
[thecoatlessprofessor.com](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/)
recommend:

```
# Delete the clang6 binary
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/clang6

# Delete the prior version of gfortran installed
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/gfortran
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/gfortran

# Remove the install receipts that indicate a package is present

# Remove the gfortran install receipts (run after the above commands)
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/com.gnu.gfortran.bom
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/com.gnu.gfortran.plist

# Remove the clang6 installer receipt
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/com.rbinaries.clang6.bom
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/com.rbinaries.clang6.plist

# Remove the Makevars file
sudo rm -rf ~/.R/Makevars
```

Then reinstall if need be...

However, none of this seems to solve my problem 
compiling PenGeomJar... The gcc compiler still can't find
`libgfortran`...
