## R-3.5.1

I am including this tip because of the problem finding RTools in R-4.0.0 beta

Mara Averick posted a solution for being unable to find RTools
[here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rtools-not-recognized-r3-5-1-rtools-3-5/11311).

## R-3.6.3

Date: 2020-04-18 

`R-3.6.3` is the last release on the R-3.6 version. I am currently running
this on my Windows computers anticipating the release of R-4.0.0.

1. I like to install R in `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3`.

- I edit `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3/etc/i386/Makeconf` adding \
  `BINPREF ?= C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/`
  
-  I edit `C:/Apps/R/R-3.6.3/etc/x64/Makeconf` adding \
   `BINPREF ?= C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/`

2. I like to install Rtools in `C:/Apps/R/Rtools`

## Preparing for R-4.0.0

### Saving a list of packages

An interesting idea from `@dailyzad` on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dailyzad/status/1253506170372980737).

1. Save your packages and versions by:

    ```
    ip <- installed.packages()
    saveRDS(ip, "path/to/current_packages.rds")
    ```

2. After re-installing base R

    ```
    ip <- readRDS(ip, "path/to/current_packages.rds")
    install.packages(ip[,1])
    ```
    
    This will re-install your packages. This might work well for a re-install
    on a new computer, but doesn't make a lot of sense for a major distribution
    update...
    


## Fun with RTools 4.0 on Windows 10

1. Create an alias to the `mingw64.exe` 64 bit shell program
and move it to the desktop or menu and use this to launch
the correct shell.

2. Update Rtools 4.0 periodically using

![Joren's example](inc/joren_shell.png)

Copy and paste from the line below...

<font size="5">
pacman -S mingw-w64-{i686,x86_64}-curl
</font>


## Getting R-4.0.0 to find RTools

From [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) The whole page is 
helpful. This had me pulling hair... For days... **Finally**, here is the
solution:

> After the installation is completed, you need to perform one more step to be
> able to compile R packages: you need to put the location of the rtools make
> utilities (bash, make, etc) on the PATH. The easiest way to do so is create a
> text file .Renviron in your Documents folder which contains the following
> line:
> 
> ```
> PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"
> ```
>
> You can do this with a text editor, or you can even do it from R like so:
>
> ## Automatically put Rtools on the PATH
>
> `writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")`
>
> Now restart R and verify that make can be found, which should show the path to
> your rtools installation. If this works you can try to install an R package
> from source:
>
> ## Confirm that make.exe is on the PATH
>
> ```
> Sys.which("make")
> "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"
> ```
> 
> ## Try to install a package
>
> ```
> install.packages("jsonlite", type = "source")
> ```
> If this succeeds, youâ€™re good!
