# Introduction

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for MacOSX.

# Package Notes

## gdal

```
Warning: osgeo/osgeo4mac/gdal2 dependency gcc was built with a different C++ standard
library (libstdc++ from clang). This may cause problems at runtime.
==> Caveats
Plugins for this version of GDAL/OGR, generated by other formulae, should
be symlinked to the following directory:

  /usr/local/lib/gdalplugins/2.2

You may need to set the following enviroment variable:

  export GDAL_DRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gdalplugins

PYTHON BINDINGS are now built in a separate formula: gdal2-python

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because older version of gdal is in main tap and installs similar components.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gdal2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/gdal2/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/gdal2/include
For pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/gdal2/lib/pkgconfig

==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/gdal2/2.2.3: 243 files, 44.3MB, built in 7 minutes 45 seconds
