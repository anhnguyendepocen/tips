### Preferred colors for maps

It helps to have consistent colors for maps. *N.B.* there are issues with R/G colorblindness here....
```
C-K    0 red
O-K  120 green
Cu-L 180 cyan
P-K  150 spring green
Pd-L  60 yellow
Pt-M  90 chartreuse green
Ag-L  30 orange
Ga-L 300 magenta

```
#### HSV Color wheel values

See [Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel)

"RBG color wheel" by DanPMK.

The 12 major colors of the color wheel, at 30 degree intervals on the HSV color wheel (shown above), are the following: red (0 degrees or 360 degrees), orange (30 degrees), yellow (60 degrees), chartreuse green (90 degrees), green (120 degrees), spring green (150 degrees), cyan (180 degrees), azure (210 degrees), blue (240 degrees), violet (270 degrees), magenta (300 degrees), and rose (330 degrees). This constitutes the complete set of primary, secondary, and tertiary color names.

### Controlling the export of maps
1. For the map you want, right click and select ``Details``.
2. Note the ``Resolution (Width)`` (e.g. 1024 px) and the ``Image Width`` (e.g. 193 um). You may want to note the ``Magnification`` as well...
3. Again for the map you want, right click and select ``Export >> Settings``. Leave ``Keep Aspect Ratio``checked and turn off what you don't want. Set to the resolution you want (i.e. 1024) and then press ``Save As...``

### Basic Info

Oxford S/N: ``CZC4081PBM``
``
System NO: ``37404``

#### The setup

There is a power strip mounted on the base of the Sirion on the bottom rail. It supplies power to the computer, monitor, the micsF+ box and the x-stream-2 box, as well as a 24 V laptop power supply. The laptop power supply plugs into a cable on the detector and another cable goes to the x-stream2 box.

One can shut the computer down and turn off the strip to turn everything off.

Note: one can use the tidy-up program to reset everything.

### Setting your own logo

The Oxford logo is in a file ``logo.png`` in ``C:\Program Files\Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis\AZtec\Reports``. It is ``150x71`` pixels. design a replacement with the same aspect ratio and rename the old one to ``logo-old.png``
