### Preferred colors for maps

It helps to have consistent colors for maps. *N.B.* there are issues with R/G colorblindness here....
```
C-K    0 red
O-K  120 green
Cu-L 180 cyan
P-K       ??
Pd-L  60 yellow
Ag-L  30 brown

```

### Controlling the export of maps
1. For the map you want, right click and select ``Details``.
2. Note the ``Resolution (Width)`` (e.g. 1024 px) and the ``Image Width`` (e.g. 193 um). You may want to note the ``Magnification`` as well...
3. Again for the map you want, right click and select ``Export >> Settings``. Leave ``Keep Aspect Ratio``checked and turn off what you don't want. Set to the resolution you want (i.e. 1024) and then press ``Save As...``

### Basic Info

Oxford S/N: ``CZC4081PBM``
``
System NO: ``37404``

#### The setup

There is a power strip mounted on the base of the Sirion on the bottom rail. It supplies power to the computer, monitor, the micsF+ box and the x-stream-2 box, as well as a 24 V laptop power supply. The laptop power supply plugs into a cable on the detector and another cable goes to the x-stream2 box.

One can shut the computer down and turn off the strip to turn everything off.

Note: one can use the tidy-up program to reset everything.

### Setting your own logo

The Oxford logo is in a file ``logo.png`` in ``C:\Program Files\Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis\AZtec\Reports``. It is ``150x71`` pixels. design a replacement with the same aspect ratio and rename the old one to ``logo-old.png``
