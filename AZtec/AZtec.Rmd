### Preferred colors for maps

It helps to have consistent colors for maps. *N.B.* there are issues with R/G colorblindness here....

<style>
table:nth-of-type(1) {
    display:table;
    width:25%;
}
</style>

| transition | deg | name             |
|------------|----:|:-----------------|
| C K        | 0   | red              |
| O K        | 120 | green            |
| Cu L       | 180 | cyan             |
| P K        | 150 | spring green     |
| Pd L       |  60 | yellow           |
| Pt M       |  90 | chartreuse green |
| Ag L       |  30 | orange           |
| Ga L       | 300 | magenta          |

**Note** One can easily see and change values from the Summary view

#### HSV Color wheel values

See [Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel)

![RBG color wheel](img/RBG_color_wheel.png)

"RBG color wheel" by DanPMK.

The 12 major colors of the color wheel, at 30 degree intervals on the HSV color wheel (shown above), are the following:



|color            | degrees|
|-----------------|-------:|
|red              |    0   |
|orange           |   30   |
|yellow           |   60   |
|chartreuse green |   90   |
|green            |  120   |
|spring green     |  150   |
|cyan             |  180   |
|azure            |  210   |
|blue             |  240   |
|violet           |  270   |
|magenta          |  300   |
|rose             |  330   |


This constitutes the complete set of primary, secondary, and tertiary color names.

### EDS Mapping parameters

#### Autolock

Current parameters below...

The best discussion starts on p. 160 of the manual. It might be worth changing my tracking image to size 512 and a dwell time of 10 us. Need to see how that changes the frame time and think about a reasonable interval (they use 10 sec).

#### EDS Mapping for 7 kV

### Controlling the export of maps
1. For the map you want, right click and select ``Details``.
2. Note the ``Resolution (Width)`` (e.g. 1024 px) and the ``Image Width`` (e.g. 193 um). You may want to note the ``Magnification`` as well...
3. Again for the map you want, right click and select ``Export >> Settings``. Leave ``Keep Aspect Ratio``checked and turn off what you don't want. Set to the resolution you want (i.e. 1024) and then press ``Save As...``

## A better proposed stategy for probe current proxy measurements

### The basic idea
 
The ``Optimize`` menu makes it easy to do a beam current measurement. It is important to configure for the correct element and process time to be relevant to our DTSA-II detectors.

![BeamCurrentMeasCfg](img/BeamCurrentMeasCfg.png)

The manual (p. 86) has a discussion of the proper element to use. They like Cr because it polishes well and does not oxidize. The K line isn't sufficiently excited to use below 15 kV.  Cu grids are convenient, but seem to have the same problem if the software wants to use the K line. Silicon chips might make a good option for a wide range of voltages but would be hard to use with my Pella XCS-8 standard Faraday cage.

It might be prudent to do a cross-over with Cu and the XCS-8 standard Faraday cage at 20 kV and compare to one of my home-made Faraday cages with a Cu grid and a Si chip at 20 kV. Anyway, one would use the measured probe currents to measure the mean cps/nA for the target elements.

One gets the required data from the ``Calculate Composition`` tab of ``Point & ID`` and then choosing the ``Spectrum Details`` from the ``Available Templates``:

Note the ``Beam Calibration Information`` section contains all we need:

An example from the Mn spectrum at 20 kV on 2014-09-04

```{r}
pc <- 0.77      # nA
pi <- 483262.0  # counts in Mn Ka
lt <- 90.4      # sec

cps <- pi/lt
cpsPerNa <- cps/pc
print(sprintf("%.2f", cpsPerNa))
```

## Alchemy...

### Distorted scan

Sometimes when image collection is stopped, the scan is offset and looks odd on the microscope display. The solution is to reset the hardware. Close AZtec and run the tidy-up program to reset everything.

### Setting your own logo

The Oxford logo is in a file ``logo.png`` in ``C:\Program Files\Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis\AZtec\Reports``. It is ``150x71`` pixels. design a replacement with the same aspect ratio and rename the old one to ``logo-old.png``



## Basic Info

Oxford S/N: ``CZC4081PBM``     
System NO:  ``37404``


### A proposed SPI Standards Block

```
1. Faraday Cup      02750-AB      $611.80
2. Cu               AS4150-AB     $178.60
3. Pd               AS4250-AB     $178.60
4. K496 (P and O)   AS7270-AB     $357.20
5. Si               AS4060-AB     $178.60
6. Co               AS4130-AB     $178.60
7. Rb2SnCl6 (Cl)    AS8230-AB     $178.60
8. Pyrolytic C      AS4030-AB     $178.60
9. Nine Hole Mount  ASTP05009-AB $2379.75
```

### The setup

There is a power strip mounted on the base of the Sirion on the bottom rail. It supplies power to the computer, monitor, the micsF+ box and the x-stream-2 box, as well as a 24 V laptop power supply. The laptop power supply plugs into a cable on the detector and another cable goes to the x-stream2 box.

One can shut the computer down and turn off the strip to turn everything off.

Note: one can use the tidy-up program to reset everything.
