# Plot digitizers

[A review](http://wiekvoet.blogspot.com/2014/01/convering-plots-to-data.html). His conclusions: The programs complement each other. Engauge is great for automated extraction, complex plots. However, it is not so easy for occasional usage. PlotDigitizer is easy to use, great if you want to manually select your points.
