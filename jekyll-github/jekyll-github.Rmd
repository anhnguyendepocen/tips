[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby package that makes it easy to design attractive blogs and web pages. It plays well with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) that are hosted on `github.io`. I have been trying to get a new blog set up. 

Here are some helpful links:

[Jonathan McClone's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) extensive guide.

[Barry Clark's](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) Jekyll-Now repository.

[Andy South's](https://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/) blog set-up. **Very helpful.**

This one looks closer to where I want to end up:

[YvesCR github](https://github.com/YvesCR/yvescr.github.io) rendered as [day-laborer.edu](http://data-laborer.eu/)
