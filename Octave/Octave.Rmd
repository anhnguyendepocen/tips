# Introduction

Gnu Octave is an Open Source program similar to Matlab.
Binaries are available [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

As of 2019-03-21, the current release is `Octave 5.1.0.0` which was
released on 2019-03-01.

On the Mac, we install via Homebrew. This installs Octave 4.4.1.

Developer MacOSX App downloads are available
[here](http://octave-app.org/Developer-Downloads.html)

There is extensive documentation
[online](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/index.html#SEC_Contents).

## Publish

Octave has a nice `publish` feature. To publish the `pub_example.m`
file, one would enter from the command line (in the correct directory...)

> publish("pub_example.m");

This creates a nice HTML file with a notebook-like format.


# Min and Max value for a matrix

This is n annoyance... Adapted from
[here](https://gist.github.com/Atlas7/6e03676da65bf467cb22d1ca42f20695).

1. Octave matrix indices start with `1` not `0`.

2. To find the minum value of the matrix and its index, one can use
   this function of the matrix `A`:
  
   ```
   [minval, row] = min(min(A,[],2));
   [minval, col] = min(min(A,[],1));
   ```
   
   and for the maximum value:
   
   ```
   [maxval, row] = max(max(A,[],2));
   [maxval, col] = max(max(A,[],1));
   ```
   
   

# Functions

I ripped hair out until I discovered one function per `.m` file...

1. Run `addpath("~/Octave")` and put functions there...
2. savepath () to save to above
3. Functions must be in `individual` files with extension `.m`
4. Test the path with `path()`


# FFTs

There is a video tutorial by Ashwith Rego (2012-11-28) on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XofmaKJ8RnA).

There is a decent tutorial
[here](https://matlabgeeks.com/tips-tutorials/how-to-do-a-2-d-fourier-transform-in-matlab/).
