# Introduction

Gnu Octave is an Open Source program similar to Matlab.
Binaries are available [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

As of 2019-03-21, the current release is `Octave 5.1.0.0` which was
released on 2019-03-01.

On the Mac, we install via Homebrew. This installs `Octave 4.4.1`.

Developer MacOSX App downloads are available
[**here**](http://octave-app.org/Developer-Downloads.html).

There is extensive documentation
[online](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/index.html#SEC_Contents).

## Publish

Octave has a nice `publish` feature. To publish the `pub_example.m`
file, one would enter from the command line (in the correct directory...)

> publish("pub_example.m");

This creates a nice HTML file with a notebook-like format.

## PDF output from jupyter notebook w/ Octave kernel

This does not work automatically. I found a workaround
[here](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

0. Install what we need from python

    See the
    [installation section](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

    ```
    conda install nbconvert
    conda install pandoc
    ```

1. use as a command line tool

    See the
    [useage section](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

    ```
    jupyter nbconvert --to latex notebook.ipynb
    ```

2. Use LaTeX to render the notebook. `TeXworks` worked fine...

   In general, I am pleased with the rendering...
   
   There are items to add to the .tex file
   
       Under `\title{}` (perhaps change):

# Min and Max value for a matrix

This is n annoyance... Adapted from
[here](https://gist.github.com/Atlas7/6e03676da65bf467cb22d1ca42f20695).

1. Octave matrix indices start with `1` not `0`.

2. To find the minum value of the matrix and its index, one can use
   this function of the matrix `A`:
  
   ```
   A=[1,2,3;4,5,6]
   [minval, row] = min(min(A,[],2));
   [minval, col] = min(min(A,[],1));
   [minval, row, col]
   ```
   
   and for the maximum value:
   
   ```
   A=[1,2,3;4,5,6]
   [maxval, row] = max(max(A,[],2));
   [maxval, col] = max(max(A,[],1));
   [maxval, row, col]
   ```

   I coded these into functions: `max_val_pos` and `min_val_pos`. 
   
   **Note:** These are maintained under version control (`git`) in the
   `global` respository in the `octave/functions` folder.

# Functions

I struggled until I discovered one can have **only one function per .m file**...

1. Run `addpath("~/Octave")` and put functions there...
2. savepath () to save to above
3. Functions must be in **individual** files with extension `.m`
4. Test the path with `path()`


# FFTs

There is a video tutorial by Ashwith Rego (2012-11-28) on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XofmaKJ8RnA).

There is a decent tutorial
[here](https://matlabgeeks.com/tips-tutorials/how-to-do-a-2-d-fourier-transform-in-matlab/).

# Using Octave in Jupyter Notebook.

This is **awesome**!

See: [Calysto's](https://github.com/Calysto/octave_kernel) Readme.rst file
for installation instructions.

- To install via conda:

   ```
   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install octave_kernel
   conda install texinfo # For the inline documentation (shift-tab) to appear.
   ```

- Configure for MacOS

   1. `.octaverc` contents
   
   ```
   addpath ('/Users/jrminter/octave', '-begin');
   setenv("GNUTERM","qt");
   ```
   
   2. Add to `.bashrc`
   
   ```
   OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE="/Applications/Octave-5.1.0.app/Contents/Resources/usr/Cellar/octave-octave-app@5.1.0/5.1.0/bin/octave-5.1.0"
   export OCTAVE_EXECUTABLE
   ```
