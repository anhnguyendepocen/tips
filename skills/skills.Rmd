# Everyone here is is smart, so distinguish yourself by being kind

I think Jesus put it like this (my paraphrase in contemporary Englise): **treat others like you would like to be treated**. I actually believe **everybody counts** even if we don't agree on everything. I think the topic includes and is greater than the boorish behavior described below.

From [thingsweholddear.blogspot.com](https://thingsweholddear.blogspot.com/2015/06/everyone-here-is-is-smart-so.html)

> Tim Hunt reckons that women ruin labs with their crying, and, to be honest, I have to admit that tears are usually my response to the minor and major incidences of sexism that permeate academia.

> I’m not crying today. I am incandescent with rage, hands shaking as I try to type this. A woman I know – a woman I love and respect, who works incredibly hard and whose contribution to her discipline, and to science at large, is immense. This woman is quitting. She has been hounded out by bullying, childish petty behaviour, and sexism. She has been failed by those whose positions within her institution mean that they are responsible for the pastoral care of staff. People have turned a blind eye to the way her colleagues and senior staff have treated her. People have told her to ‘harden up’, that it ‘comes with the territory’, that she should be quiet and not draw attention to herself. She has availed herself of the accepted routes for complaint or raising issues and these have been ignored or pushed back. She is not leaving science, but she is leaving academia, and academia’s culture is fully culpable for this. The institution she is leaving needs to step back and reflect on the organisational culture that has allowed for a toxic environment both on a local and global level – sexist slides at a faculty meeting pass without comment, a head of department refuses to speak to a member their department for more than a year without a single colleague complaining.

> I walked to work this morning carrying a cake box filled with a selection of slices and cakes for a morning tea to farewell a female PhD student who is heading off overseas for 3 months.


> Many of us enact these kinds of acts within our local academic cultures – trying to embody, with our presence and our behaviour, a kindness that is sorely lacking within universities (or science, or academia) as a whole. But I am furious today – does my kindness mean anything in the face of systemic and personal sexism that seeks to destroy women and dehumanise men?

> Today I’m warmed by my fury – I’m channelling my tears into action. In writing this, I’m drawing a line. If you work in academia, in science, especially if you have a management role in a department or school or centre or institute or faculty, you are responsible for the culture of that small part of the swirling mass of academic life. You set the tone.

> And if you aren’t actively acknowledging the systemic and personal and malign and benevolent examples of sexism that your colleagues are experiencing, if you are not actively working to both counter those experiences and support those who are living them, then you ARE the problem.

> A woman I know who gives her all for science, for research, for teaching, for service, for others – she’s leaving because of all the times you didn’t speak when you should have. All the awkward silences that were left to fester after an inappropriate comment. All the snide remarks you didn’t challenge, all the acts of sabotage you witnessed and ignored. You. Men, women, those who are fortunate enough to have seniority in academia – remember: everyone here is smart, so distinguish yourself by being kind.

# Ten things I've learned about learning a new skill

From [Katherine Firth](https://researchinsiders.blog/2018/09/20/ten-things-ive-learned-about-learning-a-new-skill/) from the University of Melbourne.

**Summary**

A PhD takes 3+ years to do because we expect it to take you that long to really nail some of the new skills you are learning (and then to keep learning as an early career and mid-career researcher!)

## When you start, you will be really rubbish at the new thing.

This is the thing I found hardest to get my head around–I was used to finding new techniques a gentle learning curve. When I started lifting weights, I could only lift the 1kg dumbbells. I couldn't do a lot of the exercises because my muscles were so weak. I was really rubbish at fitness.

## This is the most important thing

Being terrible at something the first time you try it has zero (ZERO!!!!!) correlation to whether this is a thing you can finally master.

It might mean you need to work a bit harder, stick at it a bit longer, or get a bit more expert advice to get there. But not being 'naturally good' at something doesn't mean you won't be great (or competent) at it in the end. (I can now lift quite heavy weights, and am working towards really heavy weights!)

## Keep the costs of failure small.

Like in a video game, where failing just means playing the game again, keep the stakes low while you are getting better at a skill. Try things out on your own, or with a group of people you trust. That might mean giving yourself time to rehearse with a trusted friend or mentor; or letting yourself sit down with some spare materials and mess up that procedure a few times when the lab is quiet.

## Give yourself permission to try and fail.

Try saying that difficult word out loud. Plant those seedlings you aren't sure are going to make it through the summer. Have a go making that bread dough. Try a generative writing technique.  Have a hack at R. Try to have that difficult conversation.

## Have a couple of goes before you take a break.

Stick at the new task for 25 minutes or a couple of hours. Really give it a good attempt. Try again a few times. Sometimes it just takes trying more than once for it all to 'click' into place. If it doesn't click, don't get discouraged.

## Take a break between attempts.

Trying and failing 24/7 is exhausting and depressing. After having a good go, give yourself a break. Go for lunch, sleep on it, maybe leave it for a few days or a week.

## Don't take too long of a break!

To build up a new skill, you need to repeat it. So come back to it before the week is out and try again. Sometimes your brain or body has worked it out in that time, and you wonder why you found it hard last time. Sometimes it's still hard, and goes on being hard for months or years, but each time will get a tiny bit better.

## Celebrate that you turned up and had a go.

The other day I turned up to yoga class and it was a disaster. I couldn't get into any of the poses, I just flailed all over the mat. But I still left class respecting myself for turning up. (I did have to learn to do this too, and it was hard at first, but I'm getting better at it!)

## Recognise your successes, however small!

Can you do something incrementally better than last time you tried? Has part of the new thing become easier, even as you still struggle with another part? Recognise those things and give yourself a gold star for progress! You don't have to wait to be a world expert to recognise that you are improving.

## Persist.

As I said in point (1), it's taken me years to build up my fitness. It's also taken me years to get my head around high theory, to keep a vegetable garden alive through the Australian summer, to learn how to code, to speak Italian in public, to write a decent book proposal.





# Don't outsource your thinking

[Blake Ross](https://medium.com/@blakeross/don-t-outsource-your-thinking-ad825a9b4653#.8uvbfx8ir) warns:

> Doubt the media. Always doubt the media. Many journalists are superb, but certain reporters would publish plainly inaccurate information about our products on a regular basis. And if they got our tech wrong, what were they getting wrong in that science story? That war piece?

He goes on to recommend a **healthy skepticism** and to suggest we do our own research.
