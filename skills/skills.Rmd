# Don't outsource your thinking

[Blake Ross](https://medium.com/@blakeross/don-t-outsource-your-thinking-ad825a9b4653#.8uvbfx8ir) warns:

> Doubt the media. Always doubt the media. Many journalists are superb, but certain reporters would publish plainly inaccurate information about our products on a regular basis. And if they got our tech wrong, what were they getting wrong in that science story? That war piece?

He goes on to recommend a **healthy skepticism** and to suggest we do our own research.
