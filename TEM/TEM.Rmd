> We used high purity ethane for years, it does freeze quite quickly but
> it is easy enough to thaw with a touch from a screwdriver blade or a
> quick blast of fresh ethane. We never had contamination issues with it
> until the tank was almost empty but it was expensive to buy.
>
> When I heard about ethane/propane mixed I switched over to that -- for
> ease of use I buy it ready mixed - I'm not allowed to store then tanks
> in the lab so only want to have to move one around. It's considerably
> cheaper than plain ethane, it gels slightly but never sets - I
> wouldn't go back to using ethane.
