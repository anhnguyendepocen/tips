These are John Minter's tips for a workflow using R/Sweave/LaTeX.
They were compiled from several web sources.

# xtable tips

A simple wrapper that works... Note the renaming of columns
and specificing digits. Rememeber there that there need to
be ``ncol+1`` entries in the digit vector. Still need to
learn how to put a ``%`` in a label

```
<<echo=FALSE, results=tex>>=
o.col.names <- colnames(my.df)
colnames(my.df) <- c("sample",
                        "plate (s)",
                        "pass (s)",
                        "inc 85",
                        "mean",
                        "std err",
                        "lcl",
                        "ucl")
dig <- c(0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2)
print(xtable(my.df, digits = dig,
             caption = "My Caption.",
             label = "tab:mine",
             table.placement = "tbp",
             caption.placement = "top",
             size = "small",
             table.placement="ht"), include.rownames=FALSE)
colnames(my.df) <- o.col.names
@
```
