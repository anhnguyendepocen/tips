## PowerPoint

### Footers don't show up

From [Holly Green](http://blogs.mccombs.utexas.edu/the-most/2012/06/04/when-the-slide-number-doesnt-show-in-powerpoint/)

If you're working in PowerPoint, and you want the slide number to display on the slide, the process is generally simple:

1. Go to the Insert tab.
2. Click the Slide Number button.
3. On the Slide tab, check the Slide Number box.
4. Click Apply to All to make the slide number show on all slides, or Apply to make the slide number show on just the current slide.

### Template location

On Win7 ``C:\Users\jrminter\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates``
